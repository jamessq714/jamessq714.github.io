        <h1>FAQ</h1> 

        <br><br><br>

        <h3>How big are your groups?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To ensure your comfort and safety, we guarantee no more than 12 people per tour. If there are more people in your group, we are happy to provide you with a private, prearranged tour.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our minimum group size is 2 people.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>What is the cost per tour?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The tour costs $29-$49, depending on which tour you choose. Add to this the rent cost for your bike. This will range from $14 for the 2-hour tour, and upwards to $60 for a tandem bike for a full day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Some people will want a high performance bicycle, while some are happy with a basic, 21-speed hybrid bike. There are also electrical bikes which are pricier to rent, but are a great tool if you are not used to riding up hills. Also, if you come with your own bicycle, you save on not having to rent one. Typically, for the Lazy Day in the Park Tour, the cost for someone would be: $29 for the tour + $14 for a comfort hybrid bike = $43. Renting the bicycle for the whole day would be $30.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>When do you operate?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>We operate year round – every day of the week with these exceptions: Jan. 1st, Feb. 5th, Mar. 15th, July 8th, Dec. 25th, and Dec. 31st. In case of other days of closure, please check our website.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Can kids come on the tour?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Absolutely! We collaborate with a bike rental shop that has kids’ bikes, tagalongs, and children’s seats for rent. Please ask us if you have any concerns.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>What does the level of difficulty mean?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Great question! It’s hard to make a scale that describes accurately all of our guest’s feelings of what is hard or easy. So we made a brave attempt at least!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Level 1 ride: </h2>
        <p>Minimal physical exertion is required. Very slight grade changes, and therefore mostly flat riding.</p>
        <h2>Level 2 ride:</h2>
        <p>More physically challenging, yet still ok for people who have limited riding experiences. Some uphill riding. </p>
        <h2>Level 3 ride: </h2>
        <p>A good workout for most. You will be riding a good amount of uphills. Not suitable for beginners.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This scale is meant only as a guideline, and we believe that riders of all levels will thoroughly enjoy any of the three rides. An electrical bike is a great option for those who feel that they might struggle with the uphills.</p>
