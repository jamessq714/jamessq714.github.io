        <h1>Per (pronounced “pear”)</h1>
        <h2>Owner & guide </h2>
        <br>
        <p>Per is the founder and inspiration for this company. Per has lived in San Francisco and guided tours since 2010. He has been guiding bike and walking tours in Europe since 2003. Per is able to lead tours in Italian, Swedish, English, and German.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"I want to show the beauty of San Francisco that I have come to love to every guest who comes on the tour”.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What can you expect from us? –Well, when I say us, it is actually me, Per, whom you will be dealing with from A to Z. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have worked for many other tour companies prior to starting Per’s Bike Tours, and one thing I learned from those experiences is that people like being in a smaller group, compared to being one of a big heard. I would often find myself alone, leading groups of 20+ people with little or no chance of interacting with the majority of the people. This was not something I would have signed up for, had I been on the other side of the handlebar. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, Per’s Bike Tours is unique in that you will be in a small group, you will be given personal service while dealing with the me, the owner who is 100% invested in his guests. </p>
