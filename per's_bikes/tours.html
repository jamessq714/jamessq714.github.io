          <h3>San Francisco to Sausalito Classic Ride</h3>
          <h2>9 miles/15 km, level 2, 3 hours. $39 + bike rent.</h2>
          <br>

          <p>This classic bike ride shows our guests the best the Bay Area has to offer: Panoramic views of the Northern Californian landscape, the Golden Gate Bridge, and an optional ferry ride back to the City. </p>
          <br>
          <p>This tour is ideal for those who would like to see the beauty of the Bay Area while enjoying a fun bike ride with superb views of the Bay. And you’ll be biking on the world famous Golden Gate Bridge!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our group sizes are at most 10 people, so we are able to ride at a relaxed pace with many stops to enjoy the uniqueness of the San Francisco Bay Area. The ride includes 3 moderate climbs. </p>
          <br>
          <p>If you want to experience all this, but you don't feel as though you can physically manage the ride, we suggest that you rent an electrical bicycle that will make the uphills a breeze!</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Option: </h2> <p>For those who want to bike more, this ride can be extended to Tiburon. This option adds another 10 miles/16 km to the tour for only $20. There is a ferry from Tiburon that will bring us back to SF Pier 41. It’s a great option if you have more energy and you want to see more of the country side. </p>
          <br>
